# Coffee Maker

This was originally an academic project made for COMP 4550, Real-Time Systems during winter 2020 at the University of Manitoba. This project is the logic for operating a programable coffee maker. It is designed for the STM32F4 Microcontroller unit. It cannot actually make coffee, it merely simulates the process. This project is based on FreeRTOS, a real-time operating system. This project is designed to be used with the [Keil µVision IDE](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/).

This project was developed by [@adamsk34](https://github.com/adamsk34) and [@su-dong](https://github.com/su-dong). All original work introduced by this repository is in the file [Source/main.c](Source/main.c).
